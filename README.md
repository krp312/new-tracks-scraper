# Stereogum (new tracks) Scraper

Hello web traveler! Stereogum Scraper is a simple app that downloads any new music that's on the most recent page at [stereogum.com/music](https://www.stereogum.com/music/). It requires Python 3.6.

## Please Support Emerging Artists

Many of the artists featured at [stereogum.com/music](https://www.stereogum.com/music/) are in the early stages of their careers. If you like what you hear, please support these artists by buying their stuff!

## Usage

Access your console and clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/krp312/stereogum-scraper.git`

Install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the app:

`python app.py`

If all goes well, messages will print to the console indicating what's going on.

A `Downloads` folder will be created in the `stereogum-scraper` folder.

When you see _Downloads complete!_, you're good to go!

## Desired Features

I'd like to add [Resident Advisor's new tracks](https://www.residentadvisor.net/tracks) next, but if you'd like to give it a shot, feel free to submit a pull request!

## Issues?

I'd [love to hear](https://github.com/krp312/stereogum-scraper/issues) about those too!
